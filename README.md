#Collective Certificate Management

##Description
Certification Authorities are criticals point in the today Interet security and suffer for many different attacks because of their centrality. This student project try to reinforce them by using a descentralised protocol based on CISC. It adds the possibility to collect free certificates from the Let's Encrypt CA and to submit them to a Cothority. This Cothority can then decide (by voting) if it should be added to the Skipchain or not.
